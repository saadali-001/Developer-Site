                <h3>Our Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    School has rules, and home has different rules. But when boundaries fade, confusion sets in. Students turn up in tank tops, fiddle with their phones, or look up funny backgrounds on the internet instead of paying attention. Teaching can turn into a tiring
                    task, trying to bring some structure in a space where every attendant has quick access to distractions and online discussions quickly get out of control.
                    <br>
                    <br>How can you make school a more tangible concept for the students at home? Setting up Virtual Classroom rules is an important first step. School’s in session … even when you’re attending from home!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
