                    Children learn how to independently manage their time for both short-term and long-term assignments as they develop study skills and organizational skills. Achievement and effort grades are given in the four core subjects of Language Arts, Math, Science,
                    and Social Studies. Fifth and sixth grade students are part of student-led parent conferences each year so they can join in on the discussion to support their own learning.
